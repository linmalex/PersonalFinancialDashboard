# Personal Financial Dashboard

This repository is a snapshot of a private repository, which contains the full program.

The full program enables access to a great deal of personal data. For the purposes of this repository, I have scrubbed all references to personal data. Unfortunately, for the time being, this renders the program defunct, because the program requires access to a great deal of personal data to run.

If anyone is interested in seeing the full program, I would be happy to do a live demo in a controlled setting. 

Future versions will contain demo data.
